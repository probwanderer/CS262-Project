The DTU administration released a notice dated 24 July 2020 via the official site on 30 July 2020 demanding a hefty annual fees of INR 1,90,000 to be paid just within 5 days.The notice has a punitive clause that after 5 August students will have to bear hefty fines and after 27 August their names may be struck off from the university records.The move has seen massive student protests with widespread national media coverage.Students sighted that for the last 4 months they haven’t utilized any of the college infrastructure like Library, Computer Center, Lab Infrastructure and other campus amenities and the next session being online will not utilize the same due to the ongoing pandemic of Covid-19.DTU being primarily an undergraduate institute with more than 80% students pursuing UG courses like B.Tech and majority of students coming from humble backgrounds, it is almost impossible for them to pay such a hefty fees right now within 5 day of which three are bank holidays, especially due to the adverse effects the pandemic has had on their economic condition.The Fee Structure of INR 1,90,000 of B.Tech course has more than 40% charges on Miscellaneous Heads in the name of facilities and services which the students aren’t utilizing.Hence, the students are being asked to pay for something they haven’t availed.The Govt of NCT of Delhi passed an order on 15 April 2020 asking schools be it govt or private in the capital to only charge tuition fees.Then why is the same not applicable on higher education govt institutes like DTU.The protests saw #dtufeesrelaxation trend on Twitter for a week.
